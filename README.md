# Pocillopora

Repository about the project "Genetic diversity and structure of Pocillopora spp. corals in the Gulf of Papagayo, North Pacific of Costa Rica".
This repository includes the code to analise microsatellite data and plotting STRUCTURE results.

Main data corresponds to "Pocillopora".

There are three Rmarkdown files: Data, Diversity and Structure.
- Data rmd includes code to load Pocillopora csv and transform to a genind object, which is the format used for population analysis.
- Diversity includes analysis on genetic diversity and clonality. Furthermore, a clone corrected genind object is created.
- Structure includes analysis on genetic structure and code to plot the STRUCTURE software results.
